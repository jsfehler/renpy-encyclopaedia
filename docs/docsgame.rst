Documentation Demo Game
=======================

The documentation for this project is also available inside a Ren'Py game.

A global Encyclopaedia is used to display the documentation. Also, a short demo
game is included to demonstrate how various Encyclopaedia features can be
used in the wild.

The game is available online at: https://jsfehler.itch.io/renpy-encyclopaedia
